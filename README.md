Custom implementation of the HashMap data structure as a JavaScript class as a dynamic array. This class includes my implementation of a hashing algorithm and standard methods (get, set, has, remove, length, clear, keys, values, and entries). I also added methods to manually manage the array's resizing depending on the number of elements in the array: resize, isAtCapacity, and isNearEmpty.
